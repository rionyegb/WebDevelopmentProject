# WebDevelopmentProject
Using React and Django for web development 

Task #1: Create a REST API with the following end point:http://localhost:8000/api/echos/.GET/api/echosShould 

Task #2: In this project, you will build a simple Counter application with React. The gif below shows howthe app should work. There are two buttons: Up and Down, which increments and decrementsthe counter value, respectively. There is also a text input where you can put a number andassign it to the counter. To assign a new value, you can either press Enter when the input box isfocused, or click on the Assign button.You can design your own user interface, and it doesn't have to be like the design shown here.Although UI design is not graded for this assignment, there are bonus points for nicely done UIs.
